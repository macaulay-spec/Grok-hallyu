-- Hallyu backend — 37 storage removal through the Storage API, and privileged-column guards.
--
-- Two defects, both found by replaying the live behaviour suite against the Rork Cloud project.
--
--   1. Supabase installs `storage.protect_delete()`, a BEFORE DELETE trigger on `storage.objects` and
--      `storage.buckets` that refuses *every* direct DELETE, for every role, with "Direct deletion
--      from storage tables is not allowed. Use the Storage API instead." Migrations 20, 22, 30 and 36
--      all removed bytes with `delete from storage.objects`, so each of them failed at the only
--      moment it mattered: `delete_account()` could not delete an account at all, and the media
--      sweeper could not remove an orphan or a failed upload. Nothing about the schema was wrong —
--      the division of labour was. SQL decides *what* disappears; the Storage API performs the
--      removal, because it is the only writer that is allowed to.
--
--      This migration introduces the durable queue between those two halves: SQL records a path, the
--      Edge Function drains the queue through the Storage API. A queue rather than a returned array,
--      because `purge_deleted_accounts()` hard-deletes the profile rows in the same transaction that
--      identifies the paths — after that commit nothing in the database can rediscover them.
--
--   2. `profiles_update_self` guarded `id` and `account_status`, so it looked closed, but a policy
--      cannot compare the incoming row with the stored one. `update { role: 'admin', verified: true }`
--      on your own profile passed both the USING and the WITH CHECK clause and made you an admin.
--      Column-level privileges would have to be granted per column and revoked from a SECURITY
--      DEFINER function, which breaks every legitimate self-service update; the comparison a policy
--      cannot do is exactly what a trigger is for.

-- 1. The removal queue
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- `failed_upload` the client reported the upload failed; `orphaned` nothing references the object any
-- more; `stale_catalog` catalog artwork outside the refresh window; `account_deleted` delete_account();
-- `retention_purge` purge_deleted_accounts(), after the retention window.

comment on function public.guard_profile_privileges() is
  'Refuses role, verified, account_status and deleted_at changes to anyone who is not an admin, the service role or the database owner. A row policy cannot compare the stored row with the incoming one; this trigger is the only place that can.';

create trigger profiles_guard_privileges
  before update on public.profiles
  for each row execute function public.guard_profile_privileges();
