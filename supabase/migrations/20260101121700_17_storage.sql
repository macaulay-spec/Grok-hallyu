-- Hallyu backend — 17 storage.
-- One private bucket, `media`, for everything the app uploads: post images, video clips, posters and
-- avatars. Bytes never enter Postgres — `post_media.storage_path` and `profiles.avatar_path` point at
-- object keys inside this bucket.
--
-- Object layout (the prefix is the access rule):
--   u/<user-id>/…           a member's uploads (posts, avatars) — writable only by that member
--   avatars/…               display images readable by anyone, including anonymous visitors
--   catalog/…               catalog artwork (posters/backdrops/stills) readable by anyone
--
-- The bucket stays private: reads go through a signed URL or an authenticated request, so a leaked
-- anon key cannot read a member's private shelf image. The two public prefixes are readable by
-- anyone because they are exactly what a feed card renders.
