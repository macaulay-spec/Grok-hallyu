-- Hallyu backend — 38 one ranking for every browse surface.
--
-- Genre and streaming-provider pages used to be answered by the client reading `titles` directly
-- and sorting on the raw provider `popularity` column. Trending, the world rails and For You all
-- sort on `public.catalog_relevance_score`, which folds in lifecycle, episode activity and real
-- Hallyu engagement. So the same title could sit at the top of Trending and at the bottom of its
-- own genre page, and the genre page's number was a stale provider figure rather than anything
-- Hallyu computed. Two orderings for one catalog is the bug; this removes the second one.
--
-- `browse_titles` is now the single answer to "titles matching this filter, in Hallyu's order". It
-- returns whole `titles` rows because that is what the client maps onto a Drama, and filtering is
-- deliberately done in SQL rather than by post-filtering a ranked page: filtering after ranking
-- silently drops everything that fell below the cut, so a genre page could show fewer than 24
-- titles while claiming to have more.
--
-- `catalog_relevance_score` is granted to service_role only — a client must not be able to call it
-- directly. This function is SECURITY DEFINER, so it evaluates it on the caller's behalf and the
-- grant below only exposes the ordered result.

  'Titles matching a genre / streaming provider / world filter, ordered by Hallyu relevance unless another sort is named. The single browse ordering, so genre pages cannot disagree with Trending.';

-- An unrecognised p_sort deliberately falls through to 'relevance' in the CASE above rather than
-- raising: a typo in the client degrades to the app-wide ordering instead of an error page. There
-- is no separate "is this sort valid" function — nothing calls one, and a check the server never
-- consults is documentation pretending to be a constraint.
