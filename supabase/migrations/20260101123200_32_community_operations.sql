-- Hallyu backend — 32 community operations.
--
-- Migration 07 gave rooms their tables and migration 07's policies let a member insert their own
-- membership row and delete it. That is join and leave, and nothing else could be done safely:
-- promoting a moderator, banning a member or editing a room's settings all need a server-side check,
-- because "is this person a moderator of this room" is a fact the client cannot be trusted to know.
--
-- This migration introduces ownership (migration 07 had no owner column at all, so every room was
-- unowned and unadministrable), membership requests for rooms that want them, and one RPC per
-- operation. Every RPC re-derives the caller's authority from the database before it writes anything.
