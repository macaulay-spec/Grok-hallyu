-- Hallyu backend — 36 audit-log survivability and account-deletion completeness.
--
-- Two defects that the audit trail introduced, both found auditing the phase against requirement 16
-- ("deleted-account behaviour") rather than by inference:
--
--   1. `moderation_actions.actor_id` was `not null references profiles(id) on delete restrict`. That
--      is the wrong direction for an audit log. `purge_deleted_accounts()` (migration 22) hard-deletes
--      a tombstoned profile, and `delete from public.profiles` would then be refused by the foreign
--      key for any account that had ever taken a moderation action — retention would break, silently,
--      for exactly the accounts it most needs to purge.
--
--   2. `record_moderation_action()` accepts the service role as a writer (an Edge Function acting on
--      behalf of a moderator), but it stored `auth.uid()`, which is NULL for the service role. Every
--      service-role moderation action would have failed on the not-null constraint.
--
-- The fix keeps the audit record and loses only the foreign key: the moderator's handle is copied into
-- the row at write time, so the log still names who acted long after the profile is gone.
--
-- This migration also completes `delete_account()` for the tables migrations 30 and 31 introduced.
-- Those tables hold personal data, and a tombstoned profile is never deleted, so leaving them behind
-- would keep a deleted member's uploads and shares alive indefinitely.
