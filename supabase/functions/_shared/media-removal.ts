// Draining the media removal queue through the Storage API.
//
// Supabase installs `storage.protect_delete()`, which refuses `DELETE` on `storage.objects` for
// every role — "Direct deletion from storage tables is not allowed. Use the Storage API instead."
// So the division of labour is: SQL decides *what* disappears and writes the path to
// `public.media_removal_queue`; this module is the only thing that may actually remove it.
//
// It is shared by both callers that produce deletions — media-cleanup (orphans and stale catalog
// artwork) and purge-deleted-accounts (a member's uploads after the retention window) — so the
// claim/complete bookkeeping, the batch size and the error handling cannot drift apart.
